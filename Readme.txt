***# Steps to Run ***#
Disclaimer : Without the dumped .npy files, the code will take a lot of time to process the data and build the relevant matrices.
Please go to this github link in order to access the whole code and the saved .npy files to run the code faster and more efficiently.

1. Run gen_data.py

For collaborative models,

1. Run Colabs.py

For SVD models,

1. Run SV_D.py

For CUR models,

1. Run CUR_D.py

NO NEED TO RUN METRICS.py
